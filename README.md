# bincalc

## creators & about
This project has been made in partnership with <a href="https://github.com/enderzerobl">David Moura</a>, my classmate in college. He was responsible for the JavaScript code, which brought functionality and dynamism to the calculator.

We came up with this calculator at a course we were taking together. We had approximately two days to learn the basics of web development and create this application. 

## interface & use

The user can insert in the field "BINARY" any sequence in this number system. After doing so, pressing the button "Convert" will make the results show up.

## update (jun. 2024)
A new version of this project is being worked on, one with a cleaner UI in order to bring to the user a better experience.

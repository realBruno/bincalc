# bincalc

## creators
This project has been made in partnership with <a href="https://gitub.com/enderzerobl">David Moura</a> (github.com/enderzerobl), my classmate in college. He was responsible for the JavaScript code, which brought functionality and dynamism to the calculator.

## interface and use
As you open the link that can be found on the right side of this page, you will see the following screen:

You can go ahead and insert in the field "BINARY" any sequence in this number system. After doing so, pressing the button "Convert" will make the results show up.

## updates
I am working on a new version of this project, one with a cleaner UI in order to bring to the user a better experience.
